### 2. Project Purpose

The **Luxury Watch Sales Analysis Dashboard** is a well presented analytical tool built to visualize **$1.7B in total revenue** across **198,100 luxury timepieces**. This dashboard enables market analysts and luxury retail strategists to identify high-performing brands, compare the market share of different movement types (Automatic vs. Manual), and evaluate how watch condition affects valuation across the top global manufacturers and sellers.

The dashboard was built entirely using Microsoft Excel, using its features such as:

* Excel Pivot Tables: Used to aggregate and summarize over **198,100** items into meaningful categories like Watch Condition and Watch Type.

* Excel Formulas: Utilized to calculate real time KPIs such as **Total Sales ($1.7B)** and **Average Price ($16,045K)**.

### 5. Features & Highlights

#### **A) The Business Problem**

The luxury watch market is highly volatile and dynamic with significant price variance based on brand prestige, watch condition and movement mechanism. Stakeholders often lack a centralized view to answer: Which brands dominate in volume versus value? Does a "Manual Winding" movement have a higher rate of return than "Automatic"?

#### **B) Goal of the Dashboard**

To provide a in depth view of the luxury watch market, allowing users to drill down by **Movement Type**, **Condition**, and **Watch Type** to uncover specific investment and sales opportunities.

#### **C) Key Visuals & Walkthrough**

* **KPI Scorecards:** Instant visibility into **$1.7B Total Sales**, **$16,045K Avg Price**, and the **198.1K Total Watches Sold**.
* **Watch Sales Distribution:** A donut chart revealing that Men's Watches dominate the market share at **76%**.
* **Sales by Watch Types (Movement):** A comparative pie chart showing the revenue split between **Manual Winding ($1.1B)** and **Automatic ($536.8M)**.
* **Top 10 Best Selling Watches:** A column chart ranking revenue by brand, led by **Audemars Piguet ($800.1M)** and **Patek Philippe ($245.1M)**.
* **Total Watches Sold by Top 5:** A bar chart showing **Breitling (16,854)** and **Omega (16,625)** as the volume leaders.
* **Avg Price by Top 5:** A focused bar chart highlighting the extreme premium of **Richard Mille ($2,574,439)** compared to other luxury brands.
* **Movement Trend Area Chart:** A visual comparison of sales volume across brands, categorized by movement type.
* **Interactive Slicer Panel:** Allows for deep-dive filtering by **Movement Type**, **Condition** (e.g., "Very Good," "Poor"), and **Watch Type**.

#### **D) Business Impact & Insights**

* **Value vs. Volume:** While Breitling leads in the number of units sold, Audemars Piguet generates nearly 50% of the total revenue, highlighting a "high value, low-volume" strategy.
* **Mechanical Premium:** Manual Winding movements account for over double the revenue of Automatic movements ($1.1B vs $536.8M), indicating a strong collector preference for traditional mechanics.
* **Brand Dominance:** Richard Mille operates in a league of its own regarding average price, suggesting a niche, ultra high net worth target market.
